# Next steps

- **Package docs** — Deep dive into [schema](/docs/packages/schema), [content](/docs/packages/content), [editor](/docs/packages/editor), [renderer](/docs/packages/renderer-react), and [context-events](/docs/packages/context-events).
- **Way of working** — See the repo [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/genetik-dev/genetik/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to contribute and run tests.
- **Playground source** — In this repo, `apps/docs/src/components/Playground/` and the schema in `schema.ts` and block components in `blockComponents.tsx`.
