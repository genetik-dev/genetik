# Congratulations

You've walked through the main pieces of this **tutorial**:

1. **Schema** — Block types with config and slots, plus context and editor plugin.
2. **Block components** — React components for each block, used by both editor and preview.
3. **Editor** — `EditorProvider`, `EditorDndProvider`, `BlockPalette`, and `EditorCanvas` with content state and optional context.
4. **JSON mode and preview** — `parseContentJson` for raw editing and `renderContent` for live preview.

Try the [Playground](/playground) to see it in action, and explore the source in this repo for the full schema, block components, and page wiring.
