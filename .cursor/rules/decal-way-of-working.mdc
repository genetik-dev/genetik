# Decal way of working

When changing this repo, follow the cycle. Do not skip steps.

## 1. Keep changes small and focused

One logical change per step. Split large work into smaller steps and complete the cycle for each.

## 2. Implement or update tests

- **New behavior** → add tests that define and verify it.
- **Changed behavior** → update existing tests; add new ones if needed.
- Do not leave new or modified code untested.

## 3. Add or update documentation

- Update the **Docusaurus docs app** (`apps/docs/`): add or edit pages under `apps/docs/docs/` so the change is reflected (new concepts, APIs, or guides).
- Keep docs in sync with the code.

## 4. Run tests and validation before done

- Run the **relevant tests** for changed code (e.g. package tests or full monorepo).
- Run **lint and type checks** (e.g. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check-types` from repo root).
- Fix any failures before considering the change complete.
